                <p class="ginfo">So, this is my portfolio. Here I’ll try to paint you a picture of the kind of person I am. You’ll also get to see some of the projects I’ve made as a multimedia designer during my education, and some stuff I’ve made at home just for the fun or curiousness of it. </p>

            <p>I live in Sønderborg, Denmark with my girlfriend Cecilie and our little son Hjalte. Most of my spare time I use with these guys playing house and I love it. But naturally a guy in his very late twenties has some interest on the side, and here are some of them:</p>

                <p>I love sports. Performing it and watching it. I’ve played soccer all my life and I’ve completed a marathon in the time 3h 43m 44s – and I’m going to do that again! I’m supporting 2 soccer teams: Ajax Amsterdam and Aarhus GF. Obviously, my son is being raised to support the same teams as you can see in the picture. I also love watching American football where I’m a cheese head. Yes, you read it right, it means I support the Green Bay Packers.</p>

            <p>A very fun fact about me is that I have an on/off amateur stand up comedy career. I performed at “open mics” when they’re around, and sometimes I get booked for private events to brighten up the party and put an extra smile on peoples lips. It’s a huge challenge and kind of scary at the same time. I have some on video if you want to see me in action. Or you can just book me.</p>

            <p>What can I offer? What do I know? How do I want to work? And what do I have to show for it? Hopefully what’s to come will ease your mind.</p>
            <p>I have knowledge to a bunch of systems which are key to unfold my creativity and challenge me. I’ve been working with a great portion of the adobe creative cloud. Also, I have the knowledge a lot of different systems and programs like wordpress, code editors, prototype systems like adobe XD and Figma, and of cause Microsoft office.
